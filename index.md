## What is this?

My name is Tim Hausler and I'm interested in meeting people who I could develop romantic relationships with.  _If this doc makes you think "maybe..." I encourage you to ask the question!_ Specific ideas about next steps are at the bottom of this document.

## The basics

**Age**: 30

**Gender**: Male.   

**Location**: Bay Area, currently in Berkeley   

**Interested In**: Women.  

**Monogamy?**: In the long run, I am looking for monogamy, particularly if starting a family.  That being said, I value my partner (and I!) having a variety of important people in their lives and have dated people who are poly.  If non-monogamy is important to you, we should chat! Open to casual dating in the short/medium term.

**Wants kids?**: Yes!  I've been stable in this preference for 5+ years now.  I like the idea of watching someone grow up, getting to learn their interests from them, and eventually having them be partners in our family.  It's the kind of long-term project I think is worthwhile.    

**Wants to be stay-at-home-parent?**: Flexible.  I could see myself working part time or temporarily leaving the workforce. I value the ability to spend time with friends and family, as well as the intellectual stimulation of doing work I find meaningful. My ideal situation over my lifetime includes some serving the world through work and some serving the world through being Tim just living with and supporting his people.    

## Things that matter to me in a partner

* I value intellectual curiosity--you read books, or whatever your preferred mode of learning is, and you have subjects that get you jazzed up.  Maybe they are the same as mine, maybe they're different!
* I value social connection.  We are shaped by our community--what is yours? What do you want to grow it into?  There is not just you/me, not just us, but there is a greater ecosystem of people who love and support us.  I would find joy in someone who can share that.
* I value emotional understanding.  What is it like to be you?  What is it like when something I do lands wrong?  How do we make sure we have the right spaces to talk about the important things?
* I value sexual compatibility and its complements--communication, & consent; good, giving, and game.
* I value shared play--preferably outside, preferably exploratory.

## Particular tastes
* Many of hobbies are outdoors, so it's important to me that my partner at a very bare minimum enjoys camping, and preferrably has other outdoor pursuits as well.
* I was raised in a liberal Christian church, and attend one now--although my practices have been informed by other traditions as well, particularly Buddhism.  It is _not_ important to me that my partner have the same religious attachments as I do, but if you have a strong allergy to religious stuff it might not be a good fit.

### Outdoors Stuff

I love being outdoors, particularly backpacking.  I live for the joy of the fellowship of the trail--traveling as a crew, relying on each other, with nothing else on the agenda except exploring the world and each others' company.  I also seek out different experiences that force me to try and understand our wild hinterlands from different angles, such as fishing, skiing, sea kayaking, or canoeing.  [Here are some of my trips](https://caltopo.com/m/HF4G).

### Work

I work in Alaska as a trek leader during the summers since 2021.  The camp I work for serves high school-age troops in the Scouts program, and we get to do great stuff like canoe the Yukon River or hike remote trails.

I work--like many people in the Bay Area--as a software engineer (currently doing contract work in the non-Alaska seasons).  The thing I enjoy most about my job is digging into a problem with another coworker as a foil and co-explorer.  I think best in conversation.

### Interests

As far as intellectual topics that get me "jazzed up", I like going to theater and occasional weird movies with a small group of friends and talking about it afterwards.  

I read a lot of history books--in the last decade I've been reading a lot about North and Latin American colonization--and one of my favorite stories is an alternate history about [Brazilian slaves marrying Islam and French Republicanism in the Sahel](https://www.alternatehistory.com/wiki/doku.php?id=timelines:list_of_male_rising_posts).  Social and economic histories are especially cherished.

Some books that I've loved include "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", the Odyssey, "Marriage, A History", "Pride and Prejudice", and other books you can find on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/92182561?ref=nav_mybooks).

### Social

I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life and have a cherished network of friends spread around the West Coast, some of whom I have known for decades.  I also enjoy the social serendipity of more open social spaces, like dancing (specifically into contra lately!). 

I also have family in the Bay who I stay in regular contact with--both my nuclear family of my parents and sister, and a constellation of other extended family members who have spread out to dot Sacramento, the Peninsula, and Maui.

## Call to action

I have an idea of what I want from a romantic relationship, but there is no substitute for reality.  If this profile--most of it, some of it, all of it--strikes your fancy, reach out to me on email (thausler786@gmail.com), Facebook, or through a mutual friend.

I currently live in the Bay Area, but am open to the possibility of being elsewhere in the medium- to long-term.  It's easiest to convince me to say yes to places that I have pre-existing relationships with, like Seattle; Sacramento; Portland, OR; Alaska; and Minnesota; which I visit semi-frequently.  It probably won't work long-term if you are on the East Coast.

It will probably be awkward, but that's OK.  Some strategic tolerance for awkwardness is probably a good trait to cultivate anyways--I know I feel a bit awkward writing about myself, and yet here I am, still thinking it's a good thing.
