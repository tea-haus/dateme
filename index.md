**Age**: 29    
**Gender**: Male.   
**Location**: Bay Area, currently in Berkeley   
**Interested In**: Women.  
**Monogamy?**: I lean towards monogamous.  That being said, I value my partner (and I!) having a variety of important people in their lives and have dated people who are poly.  If non-monogamy is important to you, we should chat! Open to casual dating in the short/medium term.
**Wants kids?**: Probably yes!  I've been stable in this preference for 5+ years now.  I like the idea of watching someone grow up, getting to learn their interests from them, and eventually having them be partners in our family.  It's the kind of long-term project I think is worthwhile.    
**Wants to be stay-at-home-parent?**: Flexible.  I could see myself working part time or temporarily leaving the workforce. I value the ability to spend time with friends and family, as well as the intellectual stimulation of doing work I find meaningful. My ideal situation over my lifetime includes some serving the world through work and some serving the world through being Tim just living with and supporting his people.    

## Things that matter to me in a partner

* I value intellectual curiosity--you read books, or whatever your preferred mode of learning is, and you have subjects that get you jazzed up.  Maybe they are the same as mine, maybe they're different!
* I value social connection.  We are shaped by our community--what is yours? What do you want to grow it into?  There is not just you/me, not just us, but there is a greater ecosystem of people who love and support us.  I would find joy in someone who can share that.
* I value emotional understanding.  What is it like to be you?  What is it like when something I do lands wrong?  How do we make sure we have the right spaces to talk about the important things?
* I value sexual compatibility and its complements--communication, & consent; good, giving, and game.
* I value shared play--preferably outside, preferably exploratory.

I love being outdoors, particularly backpacking.  I live for the joy of the fellowship of the trail--traveling as a crew, relying on each other, with nothing else on the agenda except exploring the world and each others' company.  I also seek out different experiences that force me to try and understand our wild hinterlands from different angles, such as fishing, skiing, or canoeing.  I worked Alaska as a trek leader this past summer 2021.  It's important to me that my partner at a very bare minimum enjoys camping, and preferrably has other outdoor pursuits as well. [Here are some of my trips](https://caltopo.com/m/HF4G).

I work--like many people in the Bay Area--as a software engineer (currently on sabbatical).  The thing I enjoy most about my job is digging into a problem with another coworker as a foil and co-explorer.  I think best in conversation.  Because of how easy it is to get fully submerged into the software jungle, I cherish connections to folks outside of the software thicket.

Intellectually I like to wander a bit.  When I was a youth I was very involved in a liberal Christian church, and still have echoes of that in my aesthetics--particularly around grace and the social technologies of inclusion.  For other religious traditions I consider myself a curious student.  During high school and college I had my world turned upside down by empiricist philosophy/Berkeley Rationalists.  There was a good period after that when I was entranced with the tension between reason and aesthetics (a la "[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)") and adult psychological development (a la [Robert Kegan](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674272316)).  Recently I've been enjoying my re-discovery of my lifelong interest in reading heavy history books.

I've lived in the Bay Area my whole life and have a cherished network of friends spread around the West Coast.  I would say that my social rhythm over my life in the Bay Area has been an alternation between close cliques and looser networks.  It has been one my life missions up to this point to try and fil-in-the-gaps of my social graph through hosting dinners for friends--we'll see where this energy turns post-pandemic.  I also enjoy the social serendipity of more open social spaces, like dancing (specifically into contra lately!) and recreational sports. 

I also have family in the Bay who I stay in regular contact with--both my nuclear family of my parents and sister, and a constellation of other extended family members who have spread out to dot Sacramento, the Peninsula, and Maui.

## Call to action

I have an idea of what I want from a romantic relationship, but there is no substitute for reality.  If this profile--most of it, some of it, all of it--strikes your fancy, reach out to me on email (thausler786@gmail.com), Facebook, or through a mutual friend.

I currently live in the Bay Area, but am open to the possibility of being elsewhere in the medium- to long-term.  It's easiest to convince me to say yes to places that I have pre-existing relationships with, like Seattle, Sacramento, Portland, Alaska, and Minnesota, which I visit semi-frequently.  It probably won't work long-term if you are on the East Coast.

It will probably be awkward, but that's OK.  Some strategic tolerance for awkwardness is probably a good trait to cultivate anyways--I know I feel a bit awkward writing about myself, and yet here I am, still thinking it's a good thing.
